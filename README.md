# Docker images for Perl

There are various things we do while developing and testing Perl
programs across several versions of Perl, and this repo provides the
code to build those images.

There is also [official Perl images from Docker](https://hub.docker.com/_/perl)
maintained at [Perl/docker-perl](https://github.com/Perl/docker-perl).
These are completely usable, basic installations that are updated
frequently.
